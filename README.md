Topology optimization by Julia

I want to test how Julia performs in topology optimization. I use the classic 88 lines of matlab code as a basis for the
comparison.

To run the matlabe code, just download the top88.m code and run in MATLAB with:
>> top88(60,20,0.5,3,3)

I write a Julia version of the code. You can run it:
>> top(60,20,0.5,3,3)
